	ReactJS originally started as a Javascript port of XHP, a version of PHP created by Facebook. The problem was to have dynamic web applications, it requires many trips to the server, which is not ideal for XHP. So, a Facebook engineer, Jordan Wilke, took it to the browser using Javascript; the result being ReactJS. It was open sourced in May of 2013. At first, people were unsure of React, but the creators quickly tried to turn that around by having a "React Tour."
