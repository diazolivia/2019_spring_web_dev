MVC (Model, View, Controller)
-----------------------------

A Model-View-Controller architecture is a design pattern for software engineers
to help separate the functionality of a application. The application can be
separated into 3 main sections.

Model
~~~~~

This section handles how the user data is handled. The data could come from
the user or a database.

View
~~~~

The view section is responisble for handling anything the user will visually see.
The user interface logic could get data from the controller and send data to the
model.

Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~

The controllers of the MVC architecture act as a interface for the view and model
sections. The controller will manipulate data that has came from a model or some
other source and send it back to the model and view [Tutorialspoint]_.

Advantages
----------

  * Show Examples [Tutorialspoint]_ [Angular]_
  * Data Binding

    * Give Code examples
    * Why Angular makes Data Binding Easy

  * SPA (Single Page Application)

    * Why AngularJS is nice for SPA programming
    * Maybe include code examples on how this is or a diagram

Disadvantages
-------------

  * Explain the learning curve to creating AngularJS Application
  * Discuss why Angular is costly
  * User must enable JS or page doesnt really do anything or show anything
