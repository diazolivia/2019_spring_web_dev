Introduction
------------
The **Accelerated Mobile Pages** (AMP) Project, is an open-source HTML framework created by Google, used to create web
pages that load smoothly and quickly. AMP prioritizes end user experience, even if it is harder on the developer. It is
designed to "fix the web of today, not the web of tomorrow". This means that when developers find optimizations that
aren't possible with today's platforms, they should participate in the development of standards to get these
optimizations implemented. Including components on your web page that can't reliably load quickly, or perform at 60fps
or higher, violates the reason that AMP exists, to make mobile pages load faster.
