What is React JS?  What will I cover in this assessment.  Thesis *To the point*

History
-------

Early signs of react can be traced back to 2010 in the form of XHP which was
a type of PHP released by Facebook with the intention of combating the
problematic occurrences of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.  Later down
the line a facebook engineer, [name here], attempted to fix the issue of
web applications making too many round-trips to the server by taking the XHP
into the browser using Javascript.  This resulted in ReactJS. [TheNewStack]_

Why ReactJS is important
------------------------

In usual cases, rendering javascript App Data to a browser is very costly.
With React JS being a library that enables web applications that requires
very little code to implement, this user interface creator and editor is a
very convenient and time saving library to use, not to mention its relatively
new presence in the world of technology. [RisingStack]_
