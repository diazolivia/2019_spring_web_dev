Responsive Web
======================

* Introduction - This is what Responsive Web is about.  This is where the thesis
  should be as well.
  A few of the main topics I will be diving into are:
    * CSS
    * Bootstrap
    * Stylebot

* When it comes to styling a web page or a mobile app or even being able to print
  out a web page there are many tools that you can use.  The main idea here is
  the CSS or a cascading style sheet.  This special document usually holds all of
  the styling and formatting for the web page or mobile app you are designing.
  

* History of topic / library of code


* Responsive Web Design
    * This is where I will go further into Responsive Web Design.  I will talk
      about the different stylesheets and what different tools you could use.
      Also, I will put some basic code blocks here to show the simpler ways you
      could use CSS to add some style or looks when it comes to resizing the page.
