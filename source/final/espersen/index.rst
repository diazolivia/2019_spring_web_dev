Responsive Web
======================

* Introduction - This is what Responsive Web is about.  This is where the thesis
  should be as well.
  A few of the main topics I will be diving into are:
    * CSS
    * Bootstrap
    * Stylebot

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When it comes to styling a web page or a mobile app or even being able to print
  out a web page there are many tools that you can use.  The main idea here is
  the CSS or a cascading style sheet.  This special document usually holds all of
  the styling and formatting for the web page or mobile app you are designing.
  This could include anything that applies to the presentation of the content on
  the page; layout, colors, and even fonts.  With a CSS file, it is easier to change
  the presentation of the content and allows the programmer to quickly change
  multiple aspects of the web page or app at once.

  Also, I will put some basic code blocks here to show the simpler ways you
  could use CSS to add some style or looks when it comes to resizing the page.
