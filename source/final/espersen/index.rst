Responsive Web
======================

* Introduction - This is what Responsive Web is about.  This is where the thesis
  should be as well.
  A few of the main topics I will be diving into are:

    * CSS
    * Bootstrap
    * Stylebot

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When it comes to styling a web page or a mobile app or even being able to print
  out a web page, there are many tools that you can use.  The main idea here is
  the CSS or a cascading style sheet.  This special document usually holds all of
  the styling and formatting for the web page or mobile app you are designing.
  This could include anything that applies to the presentation of the content on
  the page; layout, colors, and even fonts.  With a CSS file, it is easier to change
  the presentation of the content and allows the programmer to quickly change
  multiple aspects of the web page or app at once.

History of topic / library of code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* There was not always CSS and the ability to change the styling and other aspects
  of the web browser.  In the early web browsing days, when Mosaic and and other
  early stage web clients were out, the only things you could change were the color
  and style of the font you see.  Eventually, the people complained about custom
  touches and that they wanted more from their browsing clients.  That is when a few
  people teamed up and made CSS.  The first CSS idea was brought to attention by
  Bert Bos and HÃ¥kon Wium Lie.

Responsive Web Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* This is where I will go further into Responsive Web Design.  I will talk
  about the different stylesheets and what different tools you could use.
  Also, I will put some basic code blocks here to show the simpler ways you
  could use CSS to add some style or looks when it comes to resizing the page.
