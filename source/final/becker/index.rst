Introduction
-------------

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building
user interfaces. Since React is fast and flexible, it allows developers to make
complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code
called “components”. Components are essentially JavaScript
functions or classes that describe how certain parts of the user interface
should look [reactIntro]_.

History
~~~~~~~~
A software engineer at Facebook named Jordan Walke is the creator of React.
Around 2010, Facebook struggled with code maintenance. They were implementing
new features of Facebook Ads and it made the Facebook application increasingly
complex. The complexity of the application along with the increased team-members
necessary to maintain it caused Facebook to slow down as a company. They
eventually ran into many cascading updates with their user interface, and
software teams could not keep up. In 2011, Jordan Walke created the first
prototype of React called FaxJS to make everything more efficient.

In 2012, React started to be used by Facebook. On April 9th, 2012, Facebook
acquired Instagram. Instagram wanted to use Facebook's technology and this
eventually led to React being open-sourced in 2013. Initially people thought
of React as a big step backward, but over time it grew in reputation. In 2014,
Facebook started appealing to enterprises like Netflix instead of relying
on React's technical benefits as a selling point. Over the past few years
React has grown immensely and has become a leading JavaScript
library [reactHistory]_.

Popularity
~~~~~~~~~~~

React might be the most popular JavaScript library on the market right now.
In June 2018, React was mentioned in over 28% of job postings across popular
languages. Vue and Angular were far behind, with under 10% of job postings
listing them.
